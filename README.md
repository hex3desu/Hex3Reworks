# Info

A mod that reworks and rebalances some of the vanilla aspects of Risk Of Rain 2. Highly configurable.

The aim is, rather than making simple boosts or nerfs to stat values, to change how vanilla systems work:
* Items will be balanced around synergy and builds, but will still be useful on their own. No item should be unquestionably OP in all circumstances, as some are in Vanilla.
* To aid this rebalance, item drops, printers and chests will be changed in the future to allow the player to make more choices for their items, allowing players to focus on a build.
* Gold and difficulty scaling, as well as lunar coins may also be changed further ahead.

# To Do:
* Reworks for most items
* Custom item categories & category chest changes
* Lunar coin rebalance
* BetterUI Integration

# Changes

| Item  | Change | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  | **COMMON** |  |
| ![bungusImg] | **Bustling Fungus**<br>Every **10** seconds, leave behind a **fungal zone** that **heals** for **2%** <sup>(+2% per stack)</sup> of your **max health** every second to all allies within **3m** <sup>(+2m per stack)</sup>. | <details>The main problem with Bustling Fungus was that the player is almost never standing still. Its new functionality should maintain its purpose while allowing more freedom of movement for players.</details> |
|  | **UNCOMMON** |  |
| ![daisyImg] | **Lepton Daisy**<br>Release a **healing nova** during the Teleporter event, **healing** allies for **50%** of their maximum health and **weakening** enemies for **10** seconds. Occurs **1** <sup>(+1 per stack)</sup> times. | <details>Lepton Daisy had very limited use, and it always felt like it activated at an inconvenient time. Adding an AOE debuff to further aid the player should solidify it as a life saver for holdout/teleporter events.</details> |
| ![tomeImg] | **Ghor's Tome**<br>Every time you earn money, gain **2** <sup>(+2 per stack)</sup> armor for **6** seconds. Enemies have a **20%** chance to drop a treasure worth **$4**, which scales over time. | <details>Ghor's Tome is fine, but its usefulness quickly became obsolete in vanilla. This rework makes it a hybrid income/armor item, just like the Guillotine is hybrid income/damage. With just a few stacks and a roll of pennies, you can quickly become a tank. Pickup radius increased for convenience.</details> |
| ![guillotineImg] | **Old Guillotine**<br>Hitting an **elite enemy** has a **20%** chance to **steal $1 of their money** <sup>(+$1 per stack, scales over time)</sup>, dealing damage equivalent to **quadruple** the amount you've stolen. | <details>The Guillotine's effect felt a little underwhelming in the base game. This rework increases your effectiveness vs. elites like the original, but also gives a useful money boost. It scales in such a way that the income will be good early-game, but the damage will eventually become its main upside.</details> |
|  | **LEGENDARY** |  |
| ![cloverImg] | **57 Leaf Clover**<br>Hoarding money up to **$400** <sup>(+$400 per stack, scales with time)</sup> increases the chance for all of your luck-based effects by up to **50%** <sup>(+50% per stack)</sup> | <details>The Clover is powerful enough to be an instant pick in normal games. Adding a cost to its ability tones down its overall power while providing synergy with income items. Its luck bonus now works slightly different as well, as it ramps up gradually.</details> |
|  | **LUNAR** |  |
| ![rachisImg] | **Mercurial Rachis**<br>Creates a Ward Of Power at your location that provides a **Spinel Tonic** buff to all characters within **20m** <sup>(+10m per stack)</sup>, as well as a **50%** damage buff to all enemies within **60m** <sup>(+30m per stack)</sup>. | <details>The Rachis now offers more reward for higher risk. It also synergizes neatly with Spinel Tonic, clearing afflictions if you're within the ward's range.</details> |
| ![crownImg] | **Brittle Crown**<br>Each stage has **1.5x** <sup>(+0.5x per stack)</sup> the amount of interactables. These interactables will cost **2x** <sup>(+1x per stack)</sup> as much money. | <details>This new Brittle Crown allows players more freedom to spend their hard-earned money, but can easily become a problem if you don't earn enough. Its original functionality felt good but would be too powerful with the other items, so it was changed and moved to the Old Guillotine.</details> |
|  | **VOID** |  |
| ![tickImg] | **Needletick**<br>Enemies recieve a stack <sup>(+1 per stack)</sup> of **Collapse** for **400%** damage when first hit. Each time Collapse is inflicted, hitting the enemy **20** more times inflicts **Collapse** <sup>(+1 per stack)</sup> again. **Corrupts all Tri-Tip Daggers**. | <details>Overall it will proc less often than Dagger, but the pure stacking potential and consistency of the Collapse inflictions will more than make up for this.</details> |
|  | **EQUIPMENT** |  |
| ![cardImg] | **Executive Card**<br> Multishop terminals will **remain open** after use, but the remaining terminals will raise their prices by **2x**. Passively gain **$8** <sup>(Scales with time)</sup> every **8** seconds.| <details>Executive Card was a must-take in almost all situations, so incurring a cost for the raw power of having more items felt necessary. The passive interest should help with the steeper payments, but also aid synergy with other income-based items.</details> |
