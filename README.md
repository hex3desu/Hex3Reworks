# Info

A mod that reworks and rebalances some of the vanilla aspects of Risk Of Rain 2. Highly configurable.

The aim is, rather than boosting or nerfing stat values, to change how vanilla systems work:
* Items generally considered 'bad' should be given a niche, so that in certain builds they can excel.
* Powerful items should stay powerful, but have their scope reduced so that their power is relegated more to building around them.
* Lunar items must all have unique but powerful effects with a tradeoff, so they provide a strong boost to some builds but are dangerous for others.
* Make it configurable. Let the player change most of the rework if they see problems in it.
* Quality of life and clarity should be considered for all changes.
