# Info

A mod that reworks and rebalances some of the vanilla aspects of Risk Of Rain 2. Highly configurable.

The aim is, rather than making simple boosts or nerfs to stat values, to change how vanilla systems work:
* Items generally considered underpowered are given a niche to build towards a certain existing synergy (Tanking, Debuffs, Missiles, etc...).
* Powerful items will still be powerful, but their scope will be narrowed so that they work best in certain situations, not universally.
* Lunar items should always have a powerful use case, so you are never wasting lunar coins. Building around their downsides will still be key.

# Changes

| Item  | Change | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ![daisyImg] | **Lepton Daisy**<br>Release a **healing nova** during the Teleporter event, **healing** allies for **50%** of their maximum health and **weakening** enemies for **10** seconds. Occurs **1** <sup>(+1 per stack)</sup> times. | <details>Lepton Daisy had very little use for a green item. This change should maintain its purpose as an item that makes your teleporter events easier, and also give the Weaken debuff another chance to shine.</details> |
| ![rachisImg] | **Mercurial Rachis**<br>Creates a Ward Of Power at your location that provides a **Spinel Tonic** buff to all characters within **20m** <sup>(+10m per stack)</sup>. | <details>The Rachis is already a good item, so giving it a synergy with Spinel Tonic seemed like a fun way to bring the Lunar pool together. The stronger buff should raise the stakes of the fight more.</details> |
| ![tickImg] | **Needletick**<br>Enemies recieve a stack <sup>(+1 per stack)</sup> of **Collapse** for **400%** damage when first hit. Every following **10** hits, inflict **Collapse** again. **Corrupts all Tri-Tip Daggers**. | <details>Changing the proc conditions for Needletick should make it a more consistent alternative to the Tri-Tip Dagger, with the guaranteed proc on first hit being an advantage to help it compete with the Bleed effect.</details> |
