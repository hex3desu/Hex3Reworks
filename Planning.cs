/*
Lepton Daisy (+)
- Release a nova during the teleporter event (+1) that heals you and Weakens enemies for 10 seconds.

// The Lepton Daisy did very little to help the player, but changing its nova to weaken enemies should give it more power during the only time it's active.
*/

// LEGENDARY

// BOSS

// VOID

// LUNAR

/*
Mercurial Rachis (+)
- Occasionally drop a Ward Of Power that provides a Spinel Tonic buff to all characters in a 32m (+16m per stack) radius.

// The Rachis isn't a bad item, but it lacks a reason to pick it up. You would think that it makes a fight more intense, but its effects are limited.
// This change makes the rachis a higher risk/reward item, but also adds a synergy with Tonic, whose afflictions will end when you're in the rachis' range.
*/

/*
Light Flux Pauldron (R)
- Every 5 (-20%) seconds, reset all of your cooldowns, BUT cooldowns no longer regenerate naturally. Each additional stack grants a 5% chance for this to fail.

// To make Light Flux Pauldron interesting, it needed to be changed entirely. Now it acts as a cooldown equalizer, which heavily benefits some survivors but causes bad problems for others.
// The stacking mechanism makes it less consistent for the heavy cooldown reduction, but this can be alleviated by luck-enhancing items.
*/

/*
Stone Flux Pauldron (R)
- Reduce all incoming damage by 50% (+10%), BUT enemies will be resistant to high-damage attacks.

// Encourages a tanky build with a high fire rate or DoT damage, which benefits characters like MUL-T, Engineer, Acrid and others, but hurts Railgunner, Void Fiend, and more.
// This powerful effect changes how fights play out, as weak enemies will last longer, and you will need to get up close and personal to deal with them.
*/

/*
Defiant Gouge (R)
- Shrines are much more common, BUT all shrines cost 50% of your HP.

// If you have a high healing build, this is a pure upside: More items, more mountain shrines, and more cash.
// If you have no healing, this could be a terrible choice, because it takes up space on the map and bars you from using the extra shrines.
*/

/*
Beads Of Fealty (R)
- All portals have a high chance to appear at the teleporter. BUT, teleporter bosses have been strengthened and Perfected. Also...

// The Perfected aspect is underused, so it would be nice to have it appear in the world.
// Beads are literally useless 99% of the time, but increasing portal chances should give them a purpose.
*/

/*
Focused Convergence (R)
- Teleporter/holdout range is infinite, BUT the teleporter charges faster the closer you are to it.

// Tiny holdouts never feel good to run around, so having infinite range should be a good quality of life improvement for those problem holdouts.
// On the flipside, the effective range of charging the teleporter will be a lot smaller, but standing right next to it should be faster.
*/

/*
Gesture Of The Drowned (-)
- Your equipment automatically activates, BUT it is on a 50 second cooldown (-10%).

// Gesture was unbelievably OP-- the auto-activate was enough to justify picking it up. 
// Equalizing cooldowns to 50 seconds should make you consider whether you want to use it, depending on which equipment you're holding.
