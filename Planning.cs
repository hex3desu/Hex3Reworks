PLANS (Subject to change):

COOLDOWNS: Unify "cooldowns" to include item cooldowns such as Bands, Safer Spaces and more. Balance existing cooldown reduction accordingly
CRITS: Higher damage shots should have a higher crit chance, making one-shot builds more viable
ITEM SETS: Each build has its item set. Example:
    - On-kill: Larva, Wisp, Gasoline, Infusion...
    - Debuff: Gasoline, Ignition tank, Dagger, Death Mark...
    - Interaction: Polyp, Caffeinator, Fireworks...
    - Money: Pennies, Ghor's Tome, Crowdfunder, Another item?
    - Healing: Nkuhana's, Bungus, Leeching seed...
    - Consumable: Elixir, Delicate Watch...
    - Tank: Repulsion Armor, Rose Buckler, Aegis...
    - Cooldowns: Bison Steak, Bands, Safer Spaces, Brainstalks...

I want to rebalance the game around item sets, so that RoR2 feels less like you're collecting extra items for the pile, and more like you're thinking about what to get
To steer the game's balance more towards achieving builds, a few things should be done:
    - Improve options for exchanging items
    - Improve category chests and category options (Let player choose which category they want?)
    - Make item-items like Rusted Key, Shipment and Regenerating Scrap more open to choice


*/

// These are all just ideas!

// COMMON

/*
Gasoline (R)
- Killing an enemy drops a flaming pool beneath them which lasts for 5 seconds and ignites enemies for 200% (+100% per stack) damage

// Gasoline was a must-take in all circumstancees, and it made AOE incredibly easy to obtain even on single-target survivors like Railgunner. Will-O-The-Wisp also made it redundant
// It should still serve as a good area denial tool, but using it effectively won't be as simple.
*/

/*
Bustling Fungus (R)
- Every 10 seconds, leave behind a zone that heals for 2.5% (+2% per stack) of your health every second to all allies within 5m (+3m per stack). 

// Bungus had a simple issue: In RoR2, you are NEVER standing still, unless maybe you're Engineer
// This rework maintains Bungus's strength as a stationary healing source, while allowing players to roam a bit around its influence, giving them freedom
*/

/*
Bison Steak (R)
- Every 20 seconds, gain 1 point of max health. (Affected by cooldown reduction)

// Bison Steak was probably the weakest item in the game, but I wanted to keep an item that increases your max HP without it being a percent buff.
// It takes about 8-9 minutes for Bison Steak to ramp up to its original power, but it will continue from then on
*/

/*
Armor Piercing Rounds (R)
- Hits that deal over 400% damage are stronger.

// AP Rounds was just a damage boost without much that made it feel unique
// Stacking AP Rounds with Crowbars, Shurikens, or any burst damage items allows for a focus on burst damage hits. Make sure something like commando m1 can't proc this
*/

// UNCOMMON

/*
Ghor's Tome (R)
- Earning money grants a stacking armor buff that lasts 5 seconds. Killing enemies has a 20% chance to drop a gold nugget (worth 1/4 of vanilla)

// Ghor's Tome was nice to have in the beginning of the game, but after that?
// This should give it a purpose and help it synergize with Roll Of Pennies, which the armor buff highly benefits
*/

// LEGENDARY

// BOSS

/*
Halcyon Seed (R)
- Hoarding enough money spawns Aurelionite to fight by your side. (Money required to summon Aurelionite increases exponentially each time it happens this stage)

// Thematic, works well with a gold-based build, AND lots of gold is required to enter the golden coast in the first place. Neat!
*/

// VOID

/*
Pluripotent Larva (R)
- Your on-kill effects are twice as potent.

// Dio's makes the player die twice, Larva makes the enemies die twice as hard
// Forgive Me Please, Infusion, Pauldron and other on-kill items can be somewhat underpowered, especially in boss fights. Having an extra bit of synergy for them should be useful
// Original larva felt boring because it was just a free Dio's most of the time, this is a new effect entirely
*/

// LUNAR

/*
Light Flux Pauldron (R)
- Every 5 (-20%) seconds, reset all of your cooldowns, BUT cooldowns no longer regenerate naturally. Each additional stack grants a 5% chance for this to fail.

// To make Light Flux Pauldron interesting, it needed to be changed entirely. Now it acts as a cooldown equalizer, which heavily benefits some survivors but causes bad problems for others.
// The stacking mechanism makes it less consistent for the heavy cooldown reduction, but this can be alleviated by luck-enhancing items.
*/

/*
Stone Flux Pauldron (R)
- Reduce all incoming damage by 50% (+10%), BUT enemies will be resistant to high-damage attacks.

// Encourages a tanky build with a high fire rate or DoT damage, which benefits characters like MUL-T, Engineer, Acrid and others, but hurts Railgunner, Void Fiend, and more.
// This powerful effect changes how fights play out, as weak enemies will last longer, and you will need to get up close and personal to deal with them.
*/

/*
Defiant Gouge (R)
- Shrines are much more common, BUT all shrines cost 50% of your HP.

// If you have a high healing build, this is a pure upside: More items, more mountain shrines, and more cash.
// If you have no healing, this could be a terrible choice, because it takes up space on the map and bars you from using the extra shrines.
*/

/*
Beads Of Fealty (R)
- All portals have a high chance to appear at the teleporter. BUT, teleporter bosses have been strengthened and Perfected. Also...

// The Perfected aspect is underused, so it would be nice to have it appear in the world.
// Beads are literally useless 99% of the time, but increasing portal chances should give them a purpose.
*/

/*
Focused Convergence (R)
- Teleporter/holdout range is infinite, BUT the teleporter charges faster the closer you are to it.

// Tiny holdouts never feel good to run around, so having infinite range should be a good quality of life improvement for those problem holdouts.
// On the flipside, the effective range of charging the teleporter will be a lot smaller, but standing right next to it should be faster.
*/

/*
Gesture Of The Drowned (-)
- Your equipment automatically activates, BUT it is on a 50 second cooldown (-10%).

// Gesture was unbelievably OP-- the auto-activate was enough to justify picking it up. 
// Equalizing cooldowns to 50 seconds should make you consider whether you want to use it, depending on which equipment you're holding.
